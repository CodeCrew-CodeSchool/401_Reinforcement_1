## Data Types in C#


## What are they?
A data type specifies the size and type of variable values.

## Why do we need them?
It is important to use the correct data type for the corresponding variable; to avoid errors, to save time and memory, but it will also make your code more maintainable and readable. The most common data types are:

*Types of Data* 

- int: Any whole number (ex. 4, 23, 2000, 43)

- long: This is used when int is not large enough to store the value. Note that you should end the value with an "L" (ex. 15000000000L)

- double use whenever you need a number with a decimal (ex. 45.33 2.14)

- string: Stores a sequence of characters, surrounded by double quotes ( ex. "Hello World!")

- char: Stores a single character/letter, surrounded by single quotes (ex. 'L', 'I')

bool: A boolean data type is declared with the bool keyword and can only take the values true or false: (ex. bool turnOn = false;)
